# Skywriting/Ciel local deployment helper script - not to be invoked manually. This

# Add any package installations or initial (one-off) setup tasks to this
# script.
# N.B.: This script assumes root privileges are given. Need to make sure that 
# the user indeed has them. Later, we probably want to add a check to ensure 
# this and otherwise throw an error.
