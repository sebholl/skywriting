CIEL is an execution engine for distributed, parallel
computation. Like previous frameworks (such as MapReduce and Dryad),
it masks the complexity of distributed programming. Unlike those
frameworks, it offers a full general-purpose programming language,
called Skywriting, for expressing distributed coordination, which
enables developers to implement algorithms using arbitrary task
structures.
